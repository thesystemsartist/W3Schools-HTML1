Note: 
To open a file in a new VSCode window through the command prompt / terminal:

By default, if VSCode is already open, running code ./filename will open the file in the existing VSCode window.
However, if you want to ensure that the file opens in a new window , you can use the -n flag:

code ./filename

This forces VSCode to open the file in a new window, even if another instance of VSCode is already running.
